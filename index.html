                    <p>
    I&apos;m self-taught in many areas, and lack formal credentials or recent work
    experience that would help &quot;legitimize&quot; some of my skills.  LaunchCode is
    providing a valuable service by helping match companies and job candidates.</p>
    
    <p>So why start with LC 101, rather than immediately apply for an
    apprenticeship?</p>

                    <p>
    I&apos;ve done programming &apos;in the small&apos; for years, but have spent less than 15% of
    my working life as a full-time developer&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and those experiences were spread
    over several years.  The &quot;bigger&quot; stuff I&apos;ve done has been proprietary, so
    can&apos;t be shared as evidence of job-readiness.</p>
    
    <p>I need to build a reasonable project, and open-source it as evidence of my
    abilities.  I thought it would be good to complete LC 101 for its range of
    technologies and collaborative opportunities.  I had started working on CS50x,
    but really wanted to participate in an in-person course.</p>

                    <p>
    My goal is to train as a full stack engineer.  A lot of my previous work has
    involved helping customers solve both front-end and back-end challenges.  Iâ€™ve
    worked in a number of smaller companies, where being able to work on a variety
    of different problems with a broad set of tools has been crucial.</p>
